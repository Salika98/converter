","We're Califia Farms. We bring you the most delicious, good-for-the-world foods by applying creativity and innovation to nature's bounty, because we believe the world needs a healthier, plant-based food system.
We use passion, insight and intuition to whip natural ingredients into foods and drinks that actually love you back. How do our products love you back? They love your body by being natural and GMO-free. They love your planet by being sustainably-sourced. They love your taste buds by combining unique ingredients for the best flavors. They love your other senses by looking good, feeling great, and conveniently popping up at your local store: the total package.
Our name comes from the Spanish legend of Queen Califia who ruled the bountiful, mythical island of California, and is said to have been the inspiration for the name of our home state. With native Californian and beverage visionary Greg Steltenpohl as our leader, we're focused on making the future more mouthwatering by the minute.
Oh, and P.S.: Califia is pronounced like ""California."" But without the ""orn."" So now you know where we're from, too (the San Joaquin Valley, to be exact).
