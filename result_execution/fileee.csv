","C4Q creates pathways out of poverty through technology. We believe that people from every community and background—across ethnicity, gender, and socio-economic background—should have the opportunity to gain jobs in tech. We teach adults who are living in poverty and who do not have college degrees to code, help them gain software engineering jobs, and support them to become entrepreneurs.  In under a year, our graduates go from making $18,000 to over $85,000 post-program, working at leading companies such as Pinterest, Kickstarter, and LinkedIn. This success has largely been catalyzed by our incredible supporters, including Robin Hood Foundation, Google for Entrepreneurs, Blackstone, Salesforce, Guggenheim Partners, and BlackRock.
